# Task PRD: Research CLIProxyAPI Ecosystem for ProxyPal UI/UX Feature Gap Analysis

**Task ID:** task-1
**Created:** 2025-12-02
**Status:** To Do

## Goal

Research the CLIProxyAPI ecosystem (CLIProxyAPI, Management API, EasyCLI, Management Center) to identify what features ProxyPal desktop app is missing. This is a brutal honest assessment to drive UI/UX improvements.

## Research Sources

- https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI - Core proxy server
- https://help.router-for.me/management/api - Management API docs
- https://github.com/router-for-me/EasyCLI - GUI wrapper
- https://github.com/router-for-me/Cli-Proxy-API-Management-Center - Web-based management UI

## Scope

### In-Scope:

- Full feature inventory of CLIProxyAPI capabilities
- Management API endpoints and what they expose
- EasyCLI feature set (desktop GUI reference)
- Management Center feature set (web UI reference)
- Gap analysis: what ProxyPal has vs. what's available
- UI/UX recommendations based on findings

### Out-of-Scope:

- Implementation of features (research only)
- Mobile app considerations
- Third-party integrations not in CLIProxyAPI

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Complete feature matrix: CLIProxyAPI capabilities vs. ProxyPal implementation
- [ ] List all Management API endpoints with their purpose
- [ ] Screenshot/feature analysis of EasyCLI and Management Center
- [ ] Prioritized list of missing features with UI/UX impact assessment
- [ ] Actionable recommendations for ProxyPal improvements

## Dependencies

- Access to all four URLs provided
- Current ProxyPal codebase understanding

## Notes

Focus on what makes a great desktop proxy management experience. Be brutally honest about what's missing.
